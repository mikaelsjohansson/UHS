- Makes architectural decisions
- Presents 3 solution options when choices are needed
- **MUST approve all new packages/dependencies**
- Delegates tasks to engineers

### 2. Backend Engineer

- Senior Java developer
- Follows TDD (red-green-refactor)
- Escalates unclear requirements to Tech Lead
- **NEVER adds packages without Tech Lead approval**

### 3. Backend Reviewer
**File**: `rules/backend-reviewer.md`

- **MUST build code** (`mvn clean compile`)
- **MUST run tests** (`mvn test`)
- **CANNOT approve code that doesn't build or has failing tests**
- Verifies no unauthorized packages

### 4. Frontend Engineer

## Workflow

### Standard Development Flow:
1. **User Request** → Tech Lead analyzes and plans
2. **Tech Lead** → Breaks down tasks, gets approvals for packages
3. **Engineer** (Backend/Frontend) → Implements using TDD
4. **Reviewer** (Backend/Frontend) → Reviews, builds, tests, approves/rejects

### When to Use Each Role:

- **Starting a new feature/requirement**: Always start with **Tech Lead** role
- **Implementing backend code**: Use **Backend Engineer** role
- **Implementing frontend code**: Use **Frontend Engineer** role
- **Reviewing backend code**: Use **Backend Reviewer** role
- **Reviewing frontend code**: Use **Frontend Reviewer** role

## Critical Rules

1. **Package Management**: NO new packages can be added without Tech Lead approval
2. **Build & Test**: Reviewers MUST build and test before approval - NO EXCEPTIONS
3. **Escalation**: Engineers MUST escalate unclear requirements to Tech Lead
4. **TDD**: All engineers MUST follow Test-Driven Development

## How to Use

When working on this project:
- Read the appropriate role file from `rules/` directory
